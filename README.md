//temp:<br>
just .js file with functions<br>

user will include js in header<br>
then user create canvas with id in <body><br>
and in <script>just calling something like "button(canvas_id,size,color,library)"<br>

i think it will be awesome support babylon and three.js - cuz more people can use it<br>
and examples on codepen - usefull scenarious<br>
